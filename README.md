# CustomBigNumbers
This program is designed to expand past the standard e308 limitation. Primarly for the idea of Idle games, but this makes any game go huge with mega numbers.

The idea is to still have a limit but keep memory management in control.

1e1 is a power of 10

1e0B1 is a power or 10 and then a power of 1000

This could be expanded further, but the idea is to keep the number small enough to fit on mobile phones and not go across the entire screen.

B will use scientific notation so the max value will be: 9.99e999B2E+308
